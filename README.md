PRCP-1025: Flight Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete machine learning workflow for predicting flight ticket prices based on historical data. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, predictive modeling, model comparison, and a summary of challenges faced.

All tasks are completed within a single Jupyter Notebook as required for final submission.

Project Objectives
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform a detailed analysis of the dataset to understand structure, distributions, correlations, and insights related to flight pricing.

Task 2: Predictive Modeling

Build machine learning models capable of predicting flight ticket prices using relevant features such as airline, date of journey, number of stops, duration, source, and destination.

Task 3: Model Comparison

Compare the performance of multiple machine learning models to identify the most suitable model for production deployment.

Task 4: Challenges and Techniques

Document the challenges encountered during data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling, along with the techniques used to address them.
